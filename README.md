To run this chatbot, first run the ```train.py``` file to train the model. This will generate a file named ```chatbot_model.h5```<br>
After running ```train.py```, next run the ```app.py``` to initialize and start the bot.<br>

To add more terms and vocabulary to the bot, modify the ```intents.json``` file and add your personalized words and retrain the model again.
